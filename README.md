# Letâ€™s Encrypt on GKE

[GKE] (Google Kubernetes Engine) does not offer an out-of-the-box HTTPS solution
or TLS/SSL certificates for your websites today.

[Let's Encrypt][le] is a non-profit Certificate Authority that provides free
TLS/SSL certificates that can be used to secure websites with HTTPS.

In this tutorial, you will install a third-party Kubernetes controller named
[cert-manager] to your cluster. This add-on automates obtaining and renewing
TLS/SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt.

- Make sure to have a domain name and a GKE cluster ready to go!
- Estimated time: 30 minutes.
